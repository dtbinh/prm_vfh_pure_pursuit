%% Path Planning in Environments of Different Complexity
%% Introduction
% This example demonstrates how to compute an obstacle free path between two
% locations on a given map using the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) path planner.
% PRM path planner constructs a roadmap in the free space of a given map
% using randomly sampled nodes in the free space and connecting them with each
% other. Once the roadmap has been constructed, you can query for a
% path from a given start location to a given end location on the map.
%
% In this example, the map is represented as an occupancy grid map
% using imported data. When sampling nodes in the free space of a
% map, PRM uses this binary occupancy grid representation to deduce free
% space. Furthermore, PRM does not take into account the robot dimension
% while computing an obstacle free path on a map. Hence, you should inflate
% the map by the dimension of the robot, in order to allow computation of an
% obstacle free path that accounts for the robot's size and ensures collision
% avoidance for the actual robot. Define start and end locations on the
% map for the PRM path planner to find an obstacle free path.

% Use the imported |simpleMap| data and construct an occupancy grid representation

%% Define robot dimensions and inflate the map
% To ensure that the robot does not collide with any obstacles, you should inflate the map by
% the dimension of the robot before supplying it to the PRM path planner.
%
% Here the dimension of the robot can be assumed to be a circle with
% radius of 0.2 meters. You can then inflate the map by this dimension
% using the |<docid:robotics_ref.buoog0l-1 inflate>| function.
robotRadius = 0.2;

%%
% As mentioned before, PRM does not account for the dimension of the robot, and
% hence providing an inflated map to the PRM takes into account the robot
% dimension. Create a copy of the map before using the |inflate| function to
% preserve the original map.

%% Construct PRM and set parameters
% Now you need to define a path planner. Create a |<docid:robotics_ref.buooezu robotics.PRM>| object
% and define the associated attributes.
prm = robotics.PRM

%%
% Assign the inflated map to the PRM object
prm.Map = mapInflated;

%%
% Define the number of PRM nodes to be used during PRM construction. PRM
% constructs a roadmap using a given number of nodes on the given map.
% Based on the dimension and the complexity of the input map, this is one
% of the primary attributes to tune in order to get a solution between two
% points on the map. A large number of nodes create a dense roadmap and
% increases the probability of finding a path. However, having more nodes increases
% the computation time for both creating the roadmap and finding a solution.
prm.NumNodes = 50;

%%
% Define the maximum allowed distance between two connected nodes on
% the map. PRM connects all nodes separated by this distance (or less) on the map.
% This is another attribute to tune in the case of larger and/or complicated
% input maps. A large connection distance increases the connectivity
% between nodes to find a path easier, but can increase the computation
% time of roadmap creation.
prm.ConnectionDistance = 5;

% probabilistic nature of the PRM algorithm.
